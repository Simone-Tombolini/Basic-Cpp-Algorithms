# LCS longest common subsequence
 From wikipedia: The longest common subsequence (LCS) problem is the problem of finding the longest subsequence common to all sequences 
 in a set of sequences (often just two sequences). It differs from the longest common substring problem: unlike substrings, subsequences are not required to occupy consecutive positions within the original sequences.
